Thank you for downloading this project! /W/

If you want to load in custom music you have to add .wav files to the AudioFolder in the root folder
Make sure the file titles do not include spaces otherwise it will not work!

I highly encourage you to use Audacity for the conversion process.

It's free and it does the job perfectly, even allowing you to edit the waveform for different experiences.

May you score well!
